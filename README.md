# FocusFlow 🚀 – The AI-Powered Productivity Coach

## Why I Built FocusFlow 🧠💡

In today’s fast-paced world, staying productive while maintaining focus is harder than ever. I wanted a system that could **not only manage tasks but also understand my workflow, adapt to my needs, and keep me motivated**. Existing tools felt rigid, uninspiring, or too manual. That's why I built **FocusFlow** – an **AI-driven productivity assistant** designed to help you work smarter, not harder.

## Vision for FocusFlow 🌍

FocusFlow isn't just another to-do list. It’s a **personalized productivity coach** that learns from your habits, helps prioritize tasks intelligently, and guides you toward deep work. With **LLaMA 3 8B** running locally, FocusFlow ensures **privacy, speed, and offline capabilities**, making it **your own AI-powered planner**.
